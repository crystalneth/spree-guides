h2. Spree 1.2.0 Release Notes

Spree 1.2.0 introduces some fairly major changes in the basic architecture of Spree, as well as minor alterations and bugfixes.

Due to the long development cycle of Spree 1.2 in parallel with continuing development of the 1.1 branch, there may be features released in 1.2 that are already present in 1.1.

h3. Summary

There were two major addressed within this release of Spree: custom authentication and better checkout customization.

The first was the ability to use Spree in conjunction with an application that already provided its own way to authenticate users. Due to how Spree was architected in the past, this was not as easy as it could have been. In this release of Spree, the auth component of Spree has been removed completely and placed into a separate extension called "spree_auth_devise":https://github.com/spree/spree_auth_devise. If you wish to continue using this component of Spree, you will need to specify this extension as a dependency in your Gemfile. See "Issue #1512":https://github.com/spree/spree/pull/1512 for more detail about the customization.

The checkout process has always been hard to customize within Spree, and that has generated complaints in the past. We are pleased to report in the 1.2 release of Spree that this has been substaintially easier with a new checkout DSL that allows you to re-define the checkout steps in a simple manner. For more information about this, please see "Issue #1418":https://github.com/spree/spree/pull/1418 and "Issue #1743":https://github.com/spree/spree/pull/1743.

Along with these two major issues, there were also a ton of minor improvements and bug fixes, explained in detail below.

h3. Major changes (backwards incompatibility)

h4. spree_auth removal

Authentication is disabled by default within Spree as of this release, with the application supposed to be providing its own authentication. If you have an application that depended on this functionality within Spree existing, please add "spree_auth_devise":https://github.com/spree/spree_auth_devise to your Gemfile and then put this line inside +config/initializers/spree.rb+ as well:

<ruby>
Spree.user_class = "Spree::User"
</ruby>

For more information, please see the "Authentication guide":http://guides.spreecommerce.com/authentication.html.

h4. State machine customizations

Customizing the state machine within Spree now does not require you to override the entire +state_machine+ definition within Spree's +Order+ model. Instead, you are provided with the ability to define the "next" events for +Order+ objects like this:

<ruby>
Spree::Order.class_eval do
  checkout_flow do
    go_to_state :address
    go_to_state :delivery
    go_to_state :payment, :if => lambda { payment_required? }
    go_to_state :confirm, :if => lambda { confirmation_required? }
    go_to_state :complete
    remove_transition :from => :delivery, :to => :confirm
  end
end
</ruby>

For more information about customizing the checkout process within Spree, please see the "Checkout guide":http://guides.spreecommerce.com/checkout.html.

h3. Minor changes

h4. Introduce Spree::Product#master_images and Spree::Product#variant_images

+Spree::Product#master_images+ and its alias +Spree::Product#images+ only returns images belongs to master variant.

+Spree::Product#variant_images+ behaviour is changed, it is no longer return only images belongs to master variants but now also include all variants' images.

h4. Spree::Zone#country_list renamed to #zone_member_list

Please be noted that the underlying logics remain intact.

h4. Spree::Creditcard renamed to Spree::CreditCard

All occurences of Creditcard are changed to CreditCard to better follow Rails naming conventions.

h4. Assert that ImageMagick is installed during Spree installation

When installing Spree, if the ImageMagick library was not installed on the system, then the +identify+ command that Paperclip uses would fail and sample product images would not appear.

There is now a "check in place":https://github.com/spree/spree/commit/a6deb62 to ensure that ImageMagick is installed before Spree is.

h4. Sass variables can now be overriden

The variable definitions for the sass files of Spree have been moved to a separate file within Core called +app/assets/stylesheets/store/variables.css.scss+. You can override this file within your application in order to re-define the colors and other variables that Spree uses for its stylesheets.

h4. Added support for serialized preferences

Preferences can now be defined as serialized. See "7415323":https://github.com/spree/spree/commit/7415323 for more information.

h4. New UI for defining taxons and option types for a product

Rather than having the taxons and option types related to a product on two completely separate pages, they are now included on the product edit form. This functionality is provided by the Select2 JavaScript plugin, and will fall back to a typical select box if JavaScript is not available.

h4. Using the Money gem to display currencies

In earlier versions of Spree, we used +number_to_currency+ to display prices for products. This caused a problem when somebody selected a different I18n locale, as the prices would be displayed in their currency: 20 Japanese Yen, rather than 20 American Dollars, for instance.

To fix this problem, we're now parsing the prices through the Money gem which will display prices consistently across all I18n locales. To now change the currency for your site, go to Admin, then Configuration, then General Settings. Changing the currency will only change the currency symbol across all prices of your store.
